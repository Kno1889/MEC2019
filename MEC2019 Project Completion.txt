To Do: 

 - Create a file similar to Restaurants.py but with Student numbers, MacID's and fav and last

 - UI/embed Python program in HTML -> Using buttons via HTML means we don't need to handle exceptions, but we need to be able to go back & 
					order from diff. restaurants simultaneously

 - Card-Reader API to allow payment with credit/debit cards AND try to incorporate meal plan

 - Global variable to have order numbers

 - figure out delivery mechanism
	lower traffic inside La Piazza => Hospitality services employess are less occupied => could take food to the correct kiosk maybe??
